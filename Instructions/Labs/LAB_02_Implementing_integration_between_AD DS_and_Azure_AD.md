# Lab: Implementing integration between AD DS and Azure AD

## Scenario

To address concerns regarding management and monitoring overhead resulting from using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to authenticate and authorize access to Azure resources, you decide to test integration between on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Azure AD to verify that this will address business concerns about managing multiple user accounts by using a mix of on-premises and cloud resources.

Additionally, you want to make sure that your approach addresses the Information Security team's concerns and preserves existing controls applied to Active Directory users, such as sign-in hours and password policies. Finally, you want to identify Azure AD integration features that allow you to further enhance on-premises Active Directory security and minimize its management overhead, including Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server Active Directory and Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) with password writeback.

Your goal is to implement pass-through authentication between on-premises AD DS and Azure AD.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Prepare Azure AD for integration with on-premises AD DS, including adding and verifying a custom domain.
- Prepare on-premises AD DS for integration with Azure AD, including running IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool.
- Install and configure Azure AD Connect.
- Verify integration between AD DS and Azure AD by testing the synchronization process.
- Implementing Azure AD integration features in Active Directory, including Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server Active Directory and SSPR with password writeback.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Lab setup

Virtual machines: **AZ-800T00A-SEA-DC1**, **AZ-800T00A-SEA-SVR1**, and **AZ-800T00A-ADM1** must be running. Other VMs can be running, but they aren't required for this lab. 

> **Note**: **AZ-800T00A-SEA-DC1**, **AZ-800T00A-SEA-SVR1**, and **AZ-800T00A-SEA-ADM1** virtual machines are hosting the installation of **SEA-DC1**, **SEA-SVR1**, and **SEA-ADM1**

1. Select **SEA-ADM1**.
1. Sign in using the following credentials:

   - Username: **Administrator**
   - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
   - Domain: **CONTOSO**

For this lab, you'll use the available VM environment and an Azure AD tenant. Before you begin the lab, ensure that you have an Azure AD tenant and a user account with the Global Administrator role in that tenant.

## Exercise 1: Preparing Azure AD for AD DS integration

### Scenario

You need to ensure that your Azure AD environment is ready for integration with your on-premises AD DS. Therefore, you'll create and verify a custom Azure AD domain name and an account with the Global Administrator role.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Create a custom domain name in Azure.
1. Create a user with the Global Administrator role.
1. Change the password for the user with the Global Administrator role.

#### Task 1: Create a custom domain name in Azure

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, start Microsoft Edge, and then go to the Azure portal.
1. Use the credentials that you instructor provides to sign in to the Azure portal.
1. In the Azure portal, browse to **Azure Active Directory**.
1. On the **Azure Active Directory** page, select **Custom domain names**, and then add `contoso.com`.
1. Review the DNS record types that you would use to verify the domain, and then close the pane without verifying the domain name.

   > **Note**: While, in general, you would use DNS records to verify a domain, this lab doesn't require the use of a verified domain.

#### Task 2: Create a user with the Global Administrator role

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the **Azure Active Directory** page, browse to the **All Users** page and create a user account with the following properties: 

   - Username: **admin**

   > **Note**: Ensure the domain name drop-down menu for the **User name** lists the default domain name ending with `onmicrosoft.com`.

   - Name: **admin**
   - Role: **Global administrator**
   - Password: use autogenerated password

   > **Note**: Use the **Show Password** option to display the autogenerated password and record it as you'll use it later in this lab.

#### Task 3: Change the password for the user with the Global Administrator role

1. Sign out from the **Azure portal** and sign in with the user account you created in the previous task. 
1. When prompted, change the password.

   > **Note**: Record the complex password you used as you'll use it later in this lab.

## Exercise 2: Preparing on-premises AD DS for Azure AD integration

### Scenario

You need to ensure that your existing Active Directory environment is ready for Azure AD integration. Therefore, you'll run the IdFix tool, and then ensure that the UPNs of the Active Directory users match the Azure AD tenant's custom domain name.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Install IdFix.
1. Run IdFix.

#### Task 1: Install IdFix

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, open Microsoft Edge, and then go to **https://github.com/microsoft/idfix**.
