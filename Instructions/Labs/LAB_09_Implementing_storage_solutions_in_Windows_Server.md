#### Task 2: Create a volume based on a three-way mirrored disk 

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, from **Server Manager**, use the newly created storage pool **SP1** to create a virtual disk named **Three-Mirror** that uses the mirror storage layout, thin provisioning, and has the size of **25 GB**.
1. Use the newly provisioned virtual disk to create an ReFS volume named **TestData**, set its size to all available disk space, and assign to it drive letter **T**.

#### Task 3: Manage a volume in File Explorer 

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, switch to the **Windows PowerShell** hosting PowerShell Remoting session to **SEA-SVR3**.
1. Use the PowerShell Remoting session to enable all of the File and Printer Sharing rules of Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security by running the following command:

   ```
   Enable-NetFirewallRule -Group "@FirewallAPI.dll,-28502"
   ```

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, start **File Explorer** and browse to the **\\\\SEA-SVR3.contoso.com\\t$** share.
1. Create a folder named **TestData**, and then, within the folder, create a document named **TestDocument.txt**.

#### Task 4: Disconnect a disk from the storage pool and verify volume availability 

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, use **Server Manager** to add the remaining available disk attached to **SEA-SVR3** to the storage pool **SP1**. Ensure the disk uses automatic allocation.
1. Use **Server Manager** to remove one of the first three disks allocated to the **SP1** pool.
1. On **SEA-ADM1**, use File Explorer to verify that **TestDocument.txt** is still available. 

#### Task 5: Add a disk to the storage pool and verify volume availability 

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, in **Server Manager**, re-scan the **SP1** storage pool.
1. Add back the disk you removed in the previous task and ensure that it uses automatic allocation.
1. On **SEA-ADM1**, use File Explorer to verify that **TestDocument.txt** is still available. 
1. Switch back to **SEA-SVR3**.

#### Task 6: Revert disk configuration 

1. Switch back to the console session to **SEA-SVR3**.
1. At the **Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following commands to reset disks on **SEA-SVR3** to their original state:

   ```powershell
   Get-VirtualDisk -FriendlyName 'Three-Mirror' | Remove-VirtualDisk
   Get-StoragePool -FriendlyName 'SP1' | Remove-StoragePool
   for ($num = 1;$num -le 4; $num++) {Clear-Disk -Number $num -RemoveData -RemoveOEM -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue}
   for ($num = 1;$num -le 4; $num++) {Set-Disk -Number $num -IsOffline $true}
   ```

   > **Note**: This is necessary to prepare for the next exercise.
